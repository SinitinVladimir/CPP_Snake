# Raylib-CPP Snake Game - Learning Project

This repository is part of my learning journey into Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, and version control with Git and GitHub. It is based on a Raylib C++ Starter Template, originally designed for Visual Studio Code on Windows. I've used this template to build a snake game, following a YouTube tutorial, and I am applying modifications and new features as I learn.

## Branch Structure

- **Main:** Contains the project as replicated from the tutorial, serving as the baseline and stable version.
- **Features:** Dedicated to the development of new features for the snake game. Each new feature is developed in its own sub-branch.
- **Development:** This branch holds the current work-in-progress code, including integrated features from the feature branches.
- **Deploy:** A stable and deployable version of the game with all tested and finalized features.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code by double-clicking the `main.code-workspace` file.
2. In VS Code, navigate to the `src` folder and open the `main.cpp` file.
3. Press F5 to compile and run the program.

## Project Structure

- The source code is organized within the `src` folder.
- Different branches are used for developing new features, ongoing development, and stable versions.
